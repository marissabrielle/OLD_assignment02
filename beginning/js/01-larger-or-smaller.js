// Larger or Smaller?
// Usage: Use simple conditional statements
// Create an application that accepts two integers within two separate prompts. Then, display only the larger of the two within the browser window. Donâ€™t forget to handle the fact that the two could be equal.

//integer prompt 1
let num1 = Number(prompt('Enter a number between 1 and 10'));

//integer prompt 2
let num2 = Number(prompt('Enter another number between 1 and 10'));

//if number 1 is lager than number 2, display number 1
if (num1 > num2) {
    document.write(num1 + ' is greater than ' + num2);
}
//else if number 2 is larger than number 1, display number 2
 else if (num2 > num1){
    document.write(num2 + ' is greater than ' + num1);
 }
//else number 1 and number 2 are equal, display numbers are equal
 else {
    document.write(num1 + ' is equal to ' + num2);
 }
